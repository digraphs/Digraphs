# 4. Shortest Path
#############################################################################
#
# Three different "shortest path" problems are solved:
# - All pairs:       EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPaths(digraph)
# - Single source:   EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPaths(digraph, source)
# - Source and dest: EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPath (digraph, source, dest)
#
# The "all pairs" problem has two algorithms:
# - Johnson: better for sparse digraphs
# - Floyd-Warshall: better for dense graphs
#
# The "single source" problem has three algorithms:
# - If "all pairs" is already known, extract information for the given source
# - Dijkstra: faster, but cannot handle negative weights
# - Bellman-Ford: slower, but handles negative weights
#
# The "source and destination" problem calls the "single source" problem and
# extracts information for the given destination.
#
# Some of the algorithms handle negative weights, but none of them handles
# negative *cycles*. Negative cycles are checked, and if there are any the
# inner function returns fail and we call TryNextMethod.
#
# Justification and benchmarks are in the experimental part of Raiyan's MSci
# thesis, https://github.com/RaiyanC/CS5199-Proj-Code
