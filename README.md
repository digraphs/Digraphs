# GitHubPagesForGAP

This repository can be used to quickly set up a website hosted by
[GitHub](https://github.com/) for GAP packages using a GitHub repository.
Specifically, this uses [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
by adding a `gh-pages` branch to your package repository which
contains data generated from the `PackageInfo.g` file of your package.

## Initial setup

The easiest way to do this is to run the `setup-gh-pages` shell script
provided in the [GitHubPagesForGAP]() from within a git clone of your
package's GitHub repository.

In case this does not work, or if you want to really know what's going
on, you can also follow the manual instructions described after the fold.

------

The following instructions assume you do not already have a `gh-pages`
branch in your repository. If you do have one, you should delete it before
following these instructions.

1. Go into your clone of your package repository.

2. Setup a `gh-pages` branch in a `gh-pages` subdirectory.

   Users with a recent enough git version (recommended is >= 2.7.0)
   can do this using a "worktree", via the following commands:

   ```sh
   # Add a new remote pointing to the GitHubPagesForGAP repository
   git remote add -f gh-gap https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP

   # Create a fresh gh-pages branch from the new remote
   git branch gh-pages gh-gap/gh-pages --no-track

   # Create a new worktree and change into it
   git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
   cd gh-pages
   ```

   Everybody else should instead do the following, with the URL
   in the initial clone command suitably adjusted:

   ```sh
   # Create a fresh clone of your repository, and change into it
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY gh-pages
   cd gh-pages

   # Add a new remote pointing to the GitHubPagesForGAP repository
   git remote add gh-gap https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP
   git fetch gh-gap

   # Create a fresh gh-pages branch from the new remote
   git checkout -b gh-pages gh-gap/gh-pages --no-track
   ```

5. Add in copies of your `PackageInfo.g`, `README` (or `README.md`) and manual:

   ```
   cp -f ../PackageInfo.g ../README* .
   cp -f ../doc/*.{css,html,js,txt} doc/
   ```

6. Now run the `update.g` GAP script. This extracts data from your
   `PackageInfo.g` file and puts that data into `_data/package.yml`.
   From this, the website template can populate the web pages with
   some sensible default values.

   ```
   gap update.g
   ```

7. Commit and push everything.

   ```
   git add PackageInfo.g README* doc/ _data/package.yml
   git commit -m "Setup gh-pages based on GitHubPagesForGAP"
   git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
   ```

That's it. You can now see your new package website under
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/ (of course after
adjusting USERNAME and REPOSITORY suitably).


## Using an existing gh-pages branch

If you previously set up [GitHubPagesForGAP]() and thus already have a `gh-pages`
branch, you may on occasion have need to make a fresh clone of your package
repository, and then also would like to recreate the `gh-pages` directory.

The easiest way to do this is to run the `setup-gh-pages` shell script
provided in the [GitHubPagesForGAP]() from within a git clone of your
package's GitHub repository.

In case this does not work, or if you want to really know what's going
on, you can also follow the manual instructions described after the fold.

------

Users with a recent enough git version (recommended is >= 2.7)
can do this using a "worktree", via the following commands:

   ```sh
   git branch gh-pages origin/gh-pages
   git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages
   ```

If you are using an older version of git, you can instead use a second clone
of your repository instead:

   ```sh
   git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY gh-pages
   ```


## Adjusting the content and layout

[GitHubPagesForGAP]() tries to automatically provide good defaults for
most packages. However, you can tweak everything about it:

* To adjust the page layout, edit the files `stylesheets/styles.css`
and `_layouts/default.html`.

* To adjust the content of the front page, edit `index.md` (resp.
  for the content of the sidebar, edit `_layouts/default.html`

* You can also add additional pages, in various formats (HTML,
Markdown, Textile, ...).

For details, please consult the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
manual.


## Testing the site locally

If you would like to test your site on your own machine, without
uploading it to GitHub (where it is visible to the public), you can do
so by installing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static web site
generator used by GitHub to power GitHub Pages.

Once you have installed Jekyll as described on its homepage, you can
test the website locally as follows:

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.

2. Run jekyll (this launches a tiny web server on your machine):

   ```
   jekyll serve -w
   ```

3. Visit the URL http://localhost:4000 in a web browser.


## Updating after you made a release

Whenever you make a release of your package (and perhaps more often than
that), you will want to update your website. The easiest way is to use
the `release` script from the [ReleaseTools][], which performs all
the necessary steps for you, except for the very last of actually
publishing the package (and it can do even that for you, if you
pass the `-p` option to it).

However, you can also do it manually. The steps for doing it are quite
similar to the above:

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.

2. Add in copies of your `PackageInfo.g`, `README` (or `README.md`) and manual:

   ```
   cp -f ../PackageInfo.g ../README* .
   cp -f ../doc/*.{css,html,js,txt} doc/
   ```

3. Now run the `update.g` GAP script.

4. Commit and push the work we have just done.

   ```
   git add PackageInfo.g README* doc/ _data/package.yml
   git commit -m "Update web pages"
   git push
   ```

A few seconds after you have done this, your changes will be online
under https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/ .


## Updating to a newer version of GitHubPagesForGAP

Normally you should not have to ever do this. However, if you really want to,
you can attempt to update to the most recent version of [GitHubPagesForGAP]() via
the following instructions. The difficulty of such an update depends on how
much you tweaked the site after initially cloning [GitHubPagesForGAP]().

1. Go to the `gh-pages` directory we created above.
   Make sure that there are no uncommitted changes, as they will be lost
   when following these instructions.

2. Make sure the `gh-gap` remote exists and has the correct URL. If in doubt,
   just re-add it:
   ```
   git remote remove gh-gap
   git remote add gh-gap https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP
   ```

3. Attempt to merge the latest GitHubPagesForGAP.
   ```
   git pull gh-gap gh-pages
   ```

4. If this produced no errors and just worked, skip to the next step.
   But it is quite likely that you will have conflicts in the file
   `_data/package.yml`, or in your `README` or `PackageInfo.g` files.
   These can usually be resolved by entering this:
   ```
   cp ../PackageInfo.g ../README* .
   gap update.g
   git add PackageInfo.g README* _data/package.yml
   ```
   If you are lucky, these were the only conflicts (check with `git status`).
   If no merge conflicts remain, finish with this command:
   ```
   git commit -m "Merge gh-gap/gh-pages"
   ```
   If you still have merge conflicts, and don't know how to resolve them, or
   get stuck some other way, you can abort the merge process and revert to the
   original state by issuing this command:
   ```
   git merge --abort
   ```

5. You should be done now. Don't forget to push your changes if you want them
   to become public.
