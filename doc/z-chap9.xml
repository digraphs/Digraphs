  <Section><Heading>Reading and writing digraphs to a file</Heading>
    This section describes different ways to store and read graphs
    from a file in the &Digraphs; package.
    <List>
      <Mark> Graph6 </Mark>
      <Item>
	<E> Graph6 </E> is a graph data format for storing undirected graphs
	with no multiple edges nor loops of size up to <M> 2^{36} - 1 </M> in
	printable characters. The format consists of two parts. The first part
	uses one to eight bytes to store the number of vertices. And the second
	part is the upper half of the adjacency matrix converted into ASCII
	characters. For a more detail description see <URL Text='Graph6'>
	http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt</URL>.
      </Item>

      <Mark> Sparse6 </Mark>
      <Item>
	<E> Sparse6 </E> is a graph data format for storing undirected graphs
	with possibly multiple edges or loops. The maximal number of vertices
	allowed is <M> 2^{36} - 1 </M>. The format consists of two parts. The
	first part uses one to eight bytes to store the number of vertices.
	And the second part only stores information about the edges.
	Therefore, the <E> Sparse6 </E> format return a more compact encoding
	then <E> Graph6 </E> for sparse graph, i.e.  graphs where the number
	of edges is much less than the number of vertices squared.  For a more
	detail description see <URL Text='Sparse6'>
        http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt</URL>.
      </Item>

      <Mark> Digraph6 </Mark>
      <Item>
	<E>Digraph6</E> is a new format based on <E> Graph6 </E>, but designed
	for digraphs. The entire adjacency matrix is stored, and
	therefore there is support for directed edges and single-vertex loops.
	However, multiple edges are not supported.
      </Item>

      <Mark> DiSparse6 </Mark>
      <Item>
	<E>DiSparse6</E> is a new format based on <E> Sparse6 </E>, but
	designed for digraphs. In this format the list of edges is
	partitioned into increasing and decreasing edges, depending whether the
	edge has its source bigger than the range. Then both sets of edges are
	written separately in <E> Sparse6 </E> format with a separation symbol
	in between.
      </Item>
      <Mark> dreadnaut </Mark>
      <Item>
        <E>dreadnaut</E> is a graph data format designed for directed and undirected graphs.
        The format supports loops but multiple edges are ignored.  The format consists of an
        initial section that defines the graph's structural properties, such as the number of
        vertices, the starting value for vertices, and whether the graph is directed. This is followed
        by a list of edges. For more information and examples of the format see
        <URL Text="nauty and Traces User's Guide">http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Guide.html</URL>.
      </Item>
      <Mark> DIMACS </Mark>
      <Item>
        <E>DIMACS</E> is a graph data format that can be used for symmetric digraphs.
        For a more detailed description, see <Ref Oper="WriteDIMACSDigraph"/>
