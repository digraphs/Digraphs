  <Description>
    These functions can be used to specify whether &nauty; or &bliss; should be
    used by default by &Digraphs;. If &NautyTracesInterface; is not available,
    then these functions do nothing. Otherwise, by calling
    <C>DigraphsUseNauty</C> subsequent computations will default to using
    &nauty; rather than &bliss;, where possible.
    <P/>

    You can call these functions at any point in a &GAP; session, as many
    times as you like, it is guaranteed that existing digraphs remain
    valid, and that comparison of existing digraphs and newly created digraphs
    via 
    <Ref Oper="IsIsomorphicDigraph" Label="for digraphs"/>,
    <Ref Oper="IsIsomorphicDigraph" 
      Label="for digraphs and homogeneous lists"/>, 
    <Ref Oper="IsomorphismDigraphs" Label="for digraphs"/>, and
    <Ref Oper="IsomorphismDigraphs" 
      Label="for digraphs and homogeneous lists"/> are also valid.<P/>

    It is also possible to compute the automorphism group of a specific digraph
    using both &nauty; and &bliss; using <Ref Attr="NautyAutomorphismGroup"/>
    and <Ref Attr="BlissAutomorphismGroup"/>, respectively.

  <Description>

    This operation computes the automorphism group of a coloured digraph.
    A coloured digraph can be specified by its underlying digraph
    <A>digraph</A> and its colouring <A>colours</A>. Let <C>n</C> be the
    number of vertices of <A>digraph</A>. The colouring <A>colours</A> may
    have one of the following two forms:

    <List>
      <Item>
        a list of <C>n</C> integers, where <A>colours</A><C>[i]</C> is the
        colour of vertex <C>i</C>, using the colours <C>[1 .. m]</C> for some
        <C>m &lt;= n</C>; or

        a list of non-empty disjoint lists whose union is
        <C>DigraphVertices(<A>digraph</A>)</C>, such that
        <A>colours</A><C>[i]</C> is the list of all vertices with colour
        <C>i</C>.
      </Item>
    </List>

    The <E>automorphism group</E> of a coloured digraph <A>digraph</A> with
    colouring <A>colours</A> is the group consisting of its automorphisms; an
    <E>automorphism</E> of <A>digraph</A> is an isomorphism of coloured
    digraphs from <A>digraph</A> to itself.  This group is equal to the
    subgroup of <C>AutomorphismGroup(<A>digraph</A>)</C> consisting of those
    automorphisms that preserve the colouring specified by <A>colours</A>. See
    <Ref Attr="AutomorphismGroup" Label="for a digraph" />, and see <Ref
      Oper="IsomorphismDigraphs" Label="for digraphs and homogeneous lists" />
    for more information about isomorphisms of coloured digraphs. <P/>

    The form in which the automorphism group is returned depends on whether
    <A>digraph</A> has multiple edges; see <Ref Prop="IsMultiDigraph" />.

    <List>
      <Mark>for a digraph without multiple edges</Mark>

        <P/>

        For convenience, the group is returned as the direct product <C>G</C> of
        the group of automorphisms of the vertices of <A>digraph</A> with the
        stabiliser of the vertices in the automorphism group of the edges. These
        two groups can be accessed using the operation <Ref Oper="Projection"
          Label="for a domain and a positive integer" BookName="ref"/>, with the
        second argument being <C>1</C> or <C>2</C>, respectively. <P/>

        The permutations in the group <C>Projection(G, 1)</C> act on the
        vertices of <A>digraph</A>, and the permutations in the group
        <C>Projection(G, 2)</C> act on the indices of
        <C>DigraphEdges(<A>digraph</A>)</C>.
      </Item>
    </List>

    By default, the automorphism group is found using &bliss; by Tommi Junttila

    A coloured digraph can be specified by its underlying digraph <A>digraph</A>

        a list of <C>n</C> integers, where <A>colours</A><C>[i]</C> is the

    If <A>digraph</A> and <A>colours</A> together form a coloured digraph,
    <C>BlissCanonicalLabelling</C> returns a canonical labelling of the digraph
    <A>digraph</A> found using &bliss; by Tommi Junttila and Petteri Kaski.
    Similarly, <C>NautyCanonicalLabelling</C> returns a canonical labelling of

    Piperno.  Note that the canonical labellings returned by &bliss; and
    &nauty; are not usually the same (and may depend of the version used).<P/>

    The form of the canonical labelling returned
    by <C>BlissCanonicalLabelling</C> depends on whether <A>digraph</A> has

    <List>

        If the digraph <A>digraph</A> has no multiple edges, then the canonical
        labelling of <A>digraph</A> is given as a permutation of its vertices.
        The canonical representative of <A>digraph</A> can be created from
        <A>digraph</A> and its canonical labelling <C>p</C> by using the
        operation <Ref Oper="OnDigraphs" Label="for a digraph and a perm" />:
        <Log>gap> OnDigraphs(digraph, p);</Log>
      </Item>
      <Mark>for a multidigraph</Mark>
      <Item>
        The canonical labelling of the multidigraph <A>digraph</A> is given as a
        pair <C>P</C> of permutations. The first, <C>P[1]</C>, is a permutation
        of the vertices of <A>digraph</A>. The second, <C>P[2]</C>, is a
        permutation of the edges of <A>digraph</A>; it acts on the indices of
        the list <C>DigraphEdges(<A>digraph</A>)</C>.  The canonical
        representative of <A>digraph</A> can be created from <A>digraph</A> and
        its canonical labelling <C>P</C> by using the operation <Ref

        <Log>gap> OnMultiDigraphs(digraph, P);</Log>
      </Item>
    </List>
    
    In either case, the colouring of the canonical representative can easily be
    constructed. A vertex <C>v</C> (in <A>digraph</A>) has colour <C>i</C> if
    and only if the vertex <C>v ^ p</C> (in the canonical representative) has
    colour <C>i</C>, where <C>p</C> is the permutation of the canonical
    labelling that acts on the vertices of <A>digraph</A>. In particular, if
    <A>colours</A> has the first form that is described above, then the
    colouring of the canonical representative is given by:

    <Log>gap> List(DigraphVertices(digraph), i -> colours[i / p]);</Log>

    On the other hand, if <A>colours</A> has the second form above, then the
    canonical representative has colouring:

    <Log>gap> OnTuplesSets(colours, p);</Log>

  <Description>
    This operation tests for isomorphism of coloured digraphs.  A coloured
    digraph can be specified by its underlying digraph <A>digraph1</A> and its
    colouring <A>colours1</A>.  Let <C>n</C> be the number of vertices of

    two forms:

    <List>
      <Item>
        a list of <C>n</C> integers, where <A>colours</A><C>[i]</C> is the

        <C>m &lt;= n</C>; or

        <C>i</C>.
      </Item>
    </List>

    If <A>digraph1</A> and <A>digraph2</A> are digraphs without multiple edges,
    and <A>colours1</A> and <A>colours2</A> are colourings of <A>digraph1</A>
    and <A>digraph2</A>, respectively, then this operation returns <K>true</K>

  <Description>
    This operation searches for an isomorphism between coloured digraphs.  A

    <A>colours1</A>) to the digraph <A>digraph2</A> (with colouring
    <A>colours2</A>), and let <C>p</C> be the permutation of the vertices of
    <A>digraph1</A> that corresponds to <C>f</C>.  Then <C>f</C> preserves the
    colourings of <A>digraph1</A> and <A>digraph2</A> – and hence is an
    isomorphism of coloured digraphs – if <C><A>colours1</A>[i] =
      <A>colours2</A>[i ^ p]</C> for all vertices <C>i</C> in <A>digraph1</A>.
