  <Description>
    If <A>digraph</A> is a directed graph and <A>edges</A> is a list of either:
    pairs of vertices of the simple directed graph <A>digraph</A> or indices of
    edges of <A>digraph</A>, then this operation returns a directed graph
    constructed from <A>digraph</A> by removing all of the edges specified by
    <A>edges</A>.

  <Oper Name="DirectedGraphTopologicalSort" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns>A list of positive integers.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>digraph</A> is an acyclic directed graph, then this operation returns
    the vertices of <A>digraph</A> ordered so that every vertex adjacent to
    <C>i</C> occurs before <C>i</C>. <P/>

    The method used in this operation has complexity <M>O(m+n)</M> where
    <M>m</M> is the number of edges (counting multiple edges as one) and
    <M>n</M> is the number of vertices in the directed graph.

  <Oper Name="DirectedGraphTransitiveClosure" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Returns>A directed graph.</Returns>
  <Description>
    The first of these functions returns the (reflexive) transitive closure of the simple 
    directed graph <A>digraph</A>. <P/>

    A directed graph is <E>reflexive</E> if there is a loop at every vertex, and
    it is <E>transitive</E> if whenever <C>[ i, j ]</C> and <C>[ j, k ]</C> are
    edges, <C>[ i, k ]</C> is also an edge. The <E>transitive closure</E> of a
    directed graph <A>digraph</A> is the least transitive directed graph
    containing <A>digraph</A>.

gap> gr:=DirectedGraph( [ [ 4, 6 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ ], [ 5 ], [ ], [ 7, 8, 9 ],
