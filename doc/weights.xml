    <Oper Name="EdgeWeightsMutableCopy" Arg="digraph"/>
    <Returns>A list of lists of integers, floats or rationals.</Returns>
    <Description>
     <C>EdgeWeights</C> returns the list of lists of edge weights of
    the edges of the digraph <A>digraph</A>.<P/>

    More specifically, <C>weights[i][j]</C> is the weight given to the <C>j</C>th edge from vertex <C>i</C>, according to the ordering of edges given by <C>OutNeighbours(digraph)[i]</C>.<P/>

    The function <C>EdgeWeights</C> returns an immutable list of immutable
    lists, whereas the function <C>EdgeWeightsMutableCopy</C> returns a copy
    of <C>EdgeWeights</C> which is a mutable list of mutable lists.<P/>

    The edge weights of a digraph cannot be computed and must be set either
    using <C>SetEdgeWeights</C> or <Ref Func="EdgeWeightedDigraph" />.<P/>

gap> gr := EdgeWeightedDigraph([[2], [3], [1]], [[5], [10], [15]]);

        The argument <A>digraph</A> may be a digraph or a list of lists of integers, floats or rationals.<P/>

        If <A>digraph</A> is a connected digraph with edge weights, then this
        attribute returns a digraph which is a minimum spanning tree of

<#GAPDoc Label="EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPaths">
<ManSection>
  <Attr Name="EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPaths" Label="for a digraph" Arg="digraph"/>
  <Oper Name="EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPaths" Label="for a digraph and a pos int" Arg="digraph, source"/>
  <Returns>A record.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>digraph</A> is an edge-weighted digraph, this attribute returns a
    record describing the paths of lowest total weight (the <E>shortest
    paths</E>) connecting each pair of vertices.  If the optional argument
    <A>source</A> is specified and is a vertex of <A>digraph</A>, then the
    output will only contain information on paths originating from that
    vertex. <P/>

    In the two-argument form, the value returned is a record containing three
    components: <C>distances</C>, <C>parents</C> and <C>edges</C>.  Each of
    these is a list of integers with one entry for each vertex <C>v</C> as
    follows: <P/>
    <List>
      <Item>
        <C>distances[v]</C> is the total weight of the shortest path from
        <A>source</A> to <C>v</C>.
      </Item>
      <Item>
        <C>parents[v]</C> is the final vertex before <C>v</C> on the shortest
        path from <A>source</A> to <C>v</C>.
      </Item>
      <Item>
        <C>edges[v]</C> is the index of the edge of lowest weight going from
        <C>parents[v]</C> to <C>v</C>.
      </Item>
    </List>
    Using these three components together, you can find the shortest edge
    weighted path to all other vertices from a starting vertex. <P/>

    If no path exists from <A>source</A> to <C>v</C>, then <C>parents[v]</C> and
    <C>edges[v]</C> will both be <K>fail</K>.  The distance from <A>source</A>
    to itself is considered to be 0, and so both <C>parents[<A>source</A>]</C> and
    <C>edges[<A>source</A>]</C> are <K>fail</K>.
    Edge weights can have negative values, but there is currently no implemented
    method for this operation if a negative-weighted cycle exists. <P/>

    In the one-argument form, the value returned is also a record containing
    components <C>distances</C>, <C>parents</C> and <C>edges</C>, but each of
    these will instead be a list of lists in which the <C>i</C>th entry is the
    list that corresponds to paths starting at <C>i</C>. <P/>

    For a simple way of finding the shortest path between two specific vertices,
    see <Ref Oper="EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPath"/>. See also the non-weighted
    operation <Ref Oper="DigraphShortestPath"/>. <P/>

  <Oper Name="EdgeWeightedDigraphShortestPath" Arg="digraph, source, dest"/>

  <Description>
    If <A>digraph</A> is an edge-weighted digraph with vertices <A>source</A>
    and <A>dest</A>, this operation returns a directed path from <A>source</A>
    to <A>dest</A> with the smallest possible total weight.  The output is a
    pair of lists <C>[v, a]</C> of the form described in <Ref
    Oper="DigraphPath"/>.<P/>

    If <M><A>source</A> = <A>dest</A></M> or no path exists, then <K>fail</K> is
    returned.<P/>

    If <A>digraph</A> contains a negative-weighted cycle, then there is
    currently no applicable method for this attribute. <P/>

<#GAPDoc Label="DigraphMaximumFlow">
<ManSection>
  <Attr Name="DigraphMaximumFlow" Arg="digraph, start, destination"/>
  <Returns>A list of lists of integers.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>digraph</A> is an edge-weighted digraph with vertices <A>start</A> and
    <A>destination</A>, this returns a record representing the maximum flow from
    <A>start</A> to <A>destination</A> in the digraph. <P/>

    A <E>flow</E> is a function from the weighted edges of <A>digraph</A> to the
    positive real numbers, such that:
    <List>
      <Item>
        Each edge's flow is no more than its weight;
      </Item>
      <Item>
        For each vertex other than <A>start</A> and <A>destination</A>, the sum
        of flows for all incoming edges is equal to the sum of flows for all
        outgoing edges;
      </Item>
      <Item>
        The sum of flows of edges leaving <A>start</A> is equal to the sum of
        flows of edges entering <A>destination</A> (this sum is denoted
        <M>M</M>).
      </Item>
    </List>
    A <E>maximum flow</E> is a flow that maximises the value of <M>M</M>. <P/>

    The flow is represented as a list of lists where each entry is a number
    representing the flow on the edge in the corresponding position in
    <C>OutNeighbours(<A>digraph</A>)</C>.
    Note that the value <M>M</M> of the flow can be found with
    <C>Sum(DigraphMaximumFlow(<A>digraph</A>, <A>start</A>,
    <A>destination</A>)[<A>start</A>])</C>. <P/>

    This attribute is computed by an implementation of the push–relabel maximum
    flow algorithm, which has time complexity <M>O(v^2 e)</M> where <M>v</M> is
    the number of vertices of the digraph, and <M>e</M> is the number of
    edges. <P/>

    See <Ref Attr="EdgeWeights" Func="EdgeWeightedDigraph"/>.

<#GAPDoc Label="RandomUniqueEdgeWeightedDigraph">
<ManSection>
  <Oper Name="RandomUniqueEdgeWeightedDigraph" Arg="[filt, ]n[, p]"/>
  <Returns>An edge-weighted digraph.</Returns>
  <Description>
    This operation returns a random edge-weighted digraph.<P/>

    Its behaviour is the same as that of <Ref Oper="RandomDigraph"/> but the
    returned digraph will additionally have the <Ref Attr="EdgeWeights"/>
    attribute populated with random unique weights from the set
    <C>[1 .. m]</C> where <C>m</C> is the number of edges in the digraph.<P/>

    &STANDARD_FILT_TEXT;

    If <A>n</A> is a non-negative integer, then the returned digraph will have
    <A>n</A> vertices.  If the optional second argument <A>p</A> is a float with
    value <M>0 \leq </M> <A> p </A> <M> \leq 1</M>, then an edge will exist
    between each pair of vertices with probability approximately <A>p</A>.  If
    <A>p</A> is not specified, then a random probability will be assumed (chosen
    with uniform probability).<P/>
