  <Description>
    The property <C>IsUndirectedTree</C> returns <K>true</K> if the digraph
    <A>digraph</A> is an undirected tree, and the property
    <C>IsUndirectedForest</C> returns <K>true</K> if <A>digraph</A> is an
    undirected forest; otherwise, these properties return <K>false</K>. <P/>

    An <E>undirected tree</E> is a symmetric digraph without loops, in which for
    any pair of distinct vertices <C>u</C> and <C>v</C>, there is exactly one
    directed path from <C>u</C> to <C>v</C>. See <Ref
      Prop="IsSymmetricDigraph"/> and <Ref Prop="DigraphHasLoops"/>, and see
    Section <Ref Subsect="Definitions" Style="Number" /> for the definition of
    directed path. This definition implies that an undirected tree has
    no multiple edges. <P/>

    An <E>undirected forest</E> is a digraph, each of whose connected components
    is an undirected tree. In other words, an undirected forest is isomorphic to
    a disjoint union of undirected trees. See <Ref
      Attr="DigraphConnectedComponents" /> and <Ref Func="DigraphDisjointUnion"
      Label="for a list of digraphs" />. In particular, every
    undirected tree is an undirected forest. <P/>

    Please note that the digraph with zero vertices is considered to be neither
    an undirected tree nor an undirected forest.

    A digraph is a preorder digraph if and only if the digraph satisifies both
    <Ref Prop="IsReflexiveDigraph"/> and <Ref Prop="IsTransitiveDigraph"/>.
    A preorder digraph (or quasiorder digraph) <A>digraph</A> corresponds to
    the preorder relation <M>\leq</M> defined by <M>x \leq y</M> if and only
    if <C>[x, y]</C> is an edge of <A>digraph</A>.
    <P/>
      
    If the argument <A>digraph</A> is mutable, then the return value of
    this property is recomputed every time it is called.

  <Description>
    A digraph is a partial order digraph if and only if the digraph satisifies
    all of <Ref Prop="IsReflexiveDigraph"/>,
    <Ref Prop="IsAntisymmetricDigraph"/> and <Ref Prop="IsTransitiveDigraph"/>.
    A partial order <A>digraph</A> corresponds
    to the partial order relation <M>\leq</M> defined by <M>x \leq y</M> if and
    only if <C>[x, y]</C> is an edge of <A>digraph</A>.

    A digraph is an equivalence digraph if and only if the digraph satisifies

  <Description>
    A connected digraph is <E>bridgeless</E> if it is still connected (in the
    sense of <Ref Prop="IsConnectedDigraph"/>) when any edge is removed. 
    If <A>D</A> has at least 3 vertices, then <Ref
    Prop="IsBiconnectedDigraph"/> implies <C>IsBridgelessDigraph</C>;
    see <Ref Attr="ArticulationPoints"/> or <Ref Attr="Bridges"/> for a more
    detailed explanation.
    <P/>

    <C>IsBridgelessDigraph</C> returns <K>true</K> if the digraph
    <A>D</A> is bridgeless, and <K>false</K> if it is not. In
    particular, <C>IsBridgelessDigraph</C> returns <K>false</K> if
    <A>D</A> is not connected. <P/>
      
    If the argument <A>D</A> is mutable, then the return value of
    this property is recomputed every time it is called. <P/>

    Multiple edges are ignored by this method. <P/>

    The method used in this operation has complexity <M>O(m+n)</M> where
    <M>m</M> is the number of edges and <M>n</M> is the number of vertices in
    the digraph.
    <P/>

    See also <Ref Attr="Bridges"/>, <Ref Attr="ArticulationPoints"/>, and 
    <Ref Prop="IsBiconnectedDigraph"/>.
