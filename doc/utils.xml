  <Description>
    This function should be called with no argument. It executes a series of
    very demanding tests, which measure the performance of a variety of
    functions on large examples.  These tests take a long time to
    complete, at least several minutes. <P/>

    For these tests to complete, the digraphs library <C>digraphs-lib</C> must
    be downloaded and placed in the <C>digraphs</C> directory in a subfolder
    named <F>digraphs-lib</F>.
    This library can be found in the &DIGRAPHS_LIB; repository.
