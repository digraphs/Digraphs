  <Func Name="IteratorFromDigraphFile" Arg="filename [, decoder]"/>
  <Returns>An iterator.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>filename</A> is a string representing the name of a file containing
    encoded digraphs, then <C>IteratorFromDigraphFile</C> returns an iterator
    for which the value of <Ref Oper="NextIterator" BookName="ref"/> is the
    next digraph encoded in the file.
    <P/>

    If the optional argument <A>decoder</A> is specified and is a function
    which decodes a string into a digraph, then <C>IteratorFromDigraphFile</C>
    will use <A>decoder</A> to decode the digraphs contained in <A>filename</A>.
    <P/>

    The purpose of this function is to easily allow looping over digraphs
    encoded in a file when loading all of the encoded digraphs would require
    too much memory. <P/>

    To see what file types are available, see <Ref Func="WriteDigraphs"/>.

    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> filename := Concatenation(DIGRAPHS_Dir(), "/tst/out/man.d6.gz");;
gap> file := DigraphFile(filename, "w");;
gap> for i in [1 .. 10] do

  <Func Name="DigraphFile" Arg="filename [, coder][, mode]"/>
  <Returns>An IO file object.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>filename</A> is a string representing the name of a file, then
    <C>DigraphFile</C> returns an &IO; package file object for that file.
    <P/>

    If the optional argument <A>coder</A> is specified
    and is a function which either encodes a digraph as a string, or decodes a
    string into a digraph, then this function will be used when reading or
    writing to the returned file object. If the optional argument <A>coder</A>
    is not specified, then the encoding of the digraphs in the returned file
    object must be specified in the the file extension. The file extension must
    be one of: <C>.g6</C>, <C>.s6</C>, <C>.d6</C>, <C>.ds6</C>, <C>.txt</C>,
    <C>.p</C>, or <C>.pickle</C>; more details of these file formats is given
    below. <P/>

    If the optional argument <A>mode</A> is specified, then it must be one of:
    <C>"w"</C> (for write), <C>"a"</C> (for append), or <C>"r"</C> (for read).
    If <A>mode</A> is not specified, then <C>"r"</C> is used by default. <P/>

    If <A>filename</A> ends in one of: <C>.gz</C>, <C>.bz2</C>, or
    <C>.xz</C>, then the digraphs which are read from, or written to, the
    returned file object are decompressed, or compressed, appropriately.
    <P/>

    The file object returned by <C>DigraphFile</C> can be given as the first
    argument for either of the functions <Ref Func="ReadDigraphs"/> or <Ref
      Func="WriteDigraphs"/>. The purpose of this is to reduce the overhead of
    recreating the file object inside the functions <Ref Func="ReadDigraphs"/>
    or <Ref Func="WriteDigraphs"/> when, for example, reading or writing many
    digraphs in a loop.
    <P/>

  <Description>
    These two functions return a function which encodes or decodes a digraph in

    <A>DigraphPlainTextLineEncoder</A> returns a function which takes a single
    digraph as an argument.  The function returns a string describing the edges
    of that digraph; each edge is written as a pair of integers separated by the

    string <A>delimiter1</A>.  <A>DigraphPlainTextLineDecoder</A> returns the
    corresponding decoder function, which takes a string argument in this format
    and returns a digraph.<P/>

    If only one delimiter is passed as an argument to
    <A>DigraphPlainTextLineDecoder</A>, it will return a function which decodes
    a single edge, returning its contents as a list of integers.<P/>

    The argument <A>offset</A> should be an integer, which will describe a

    decoded.  This may be used, for example, to label vertices starting at 0

    takes such a string and returns the digraph which it describes.  Each edge
    is written as a pair of integers separated by a single space.  The edges
    themselves are separated by a double space.  Vertex numbers are reduced by
    1 when they are encoded, so that vertices in the string are labelled

    These functions write and read a single digraph in a human-readable plain
    text format as follows: each line contains a single edge, and each edge is
    written as a pair of integers separated by the string <A>delimiter</A>.<P/>

    <A>filename</A> should be the name of a file which will be written to or
    read from, and <A>offset</A> should be an integer which is added to each
    vertex number as it is written or read.  For example, if
    <C>WritePlainTextDigraph</C> is called with <A>offset</A> <C>-1</C>, then
    the vertices will be numbered in the file starting from 0 instead of 1 -
    <C>ReadPlainTextDigraph</C> would then need to be called with <A>offset</A>
    <C>1</C> to convert back to the original graph.<P/>

    <A>ignore</A> should be a list of characters which will be ignored when

    be written to or read from.  A file can contain one symmetric digraph in
    DIMACS format. If <A>filename</A> ends in one of <C>.gz</C>, <C>.bz2</C>,
    or <C>.xz</C>, then the file is compressed, or decompressed, appropriately.
    <P/>

    The DIMACS format is described as follows.  Each line in the DIMACS file has
    one of four types:
    <List>
      <Item>
        A line beginning with <C>c</C> and followed by any number of characters
        is a comment line, and is ignored.
      </Item>
      <Item>
        A line beginning with <C>p</C> defines the numbers of vertices and edges
        the digraph.  This line has the format <C>p edge &lt;nr_vertices&gt;
          &lt;nr_edges&gt;</C>, where <C>&lt;nr_vertices&gt;</C> and
        <C>&lt;nr_edges&gt;</C> are replaced by the relevant integers. There
        must be exactly one such line in the file, and it must occur before any
        of the following kinds of line.<P/>

        Although it is required to be present, the value of
        <C>&lt;nr_edges&gt;</C> will be ignored. The correct number of edges
        will be deduced from the rest of the information in the file.
      </Item>
      <Item>
        A line of the form <C>e &lt;v&gt; &lt;w&gt;</C>, where <C>&lt;v&gt;</C>
        and <C>&lt;w&gt;</C> are integers in the range <C>[1 ..
          &lt;nr_vertices&gt;]</C>, specifies that there is a (symmetric) edge
        in the digraph between the vertices <C>&lt;v&gt;</C> and
        <C>&lt;w&gt;</C>. A symmetric edge only needs to be defined once; an
        additional line <C>e &lt;v&gt; &lt;w&gt;</C>, or <C>e &lt;w&gt;
          &lt;v&gt;</C>, will be interpreted as an additional, multiple, edge.
        Loops are permitted.
      </Item>
      <Item>
        A line of the form <C>n &lt;v&gt; &lt;label&gt;</C>, where
        <C>&lt;v&gt;</C> is an integer in the range <C>[1 ..
          &lt;nr_vertices&gt;]</C> and <C>&lt;label&gt;</C> is an integer,
        signifies that the vertex <C>&lt;v&gt;</C> has the label
        <C>&lt;label&gt;</C> in the digraph. If a label is not specified for a
        vertex, then <C>ReadDIMACSDigraph</C> will assign the label
        <C>1</C>, according to the DIMACS specification.
      </Item>
    </List>

    A detailed definition of the DIMACS format can be found at
    <URL>http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/COLOR/general/ccformat.ps</URL>, in Section
    2.1. Note that optional descriptor lines, as described in Section 2.1, will
    be ignored.

<#GAPDoc Label="TournamentLineDecoder">
<ManSection>
  <Func Name="TournamentLineDecoder" Arg="str"/>
  <Returns>A digraph.</Returns>
  <Description>
    This function takes a string <A>str</A>, decodes it, and then returns the
    tournament [see <Ref Prop="IsTournament"/>] which it defines, according to
    the following rules. <P/>

    The characters of the string <A>str</A> represent the entries in the upper
    triangle of a tournament's adjacency matrix. The number of vertices
    <C>n</C> will be detected from the length of the string and will be as
    large as possible.  <P/>

    The first character represents the possible edge <C>1 -> 2</C>, the second
    represents <C>1 -> 3</C> and so on until <C>1 -> n</C>; then the following
    character represents <C>2 -> 3</C>, and so on up to the character which
    represents the edge <C>n-1 -> n</C>. <P/>

    If a character of the string with corresponding edge <C>i -> j</C> is equal
    to <C>1</C>, then the edge <C>i -> j</C> is present in the tournament.
    Otherwise, the edge <C>i -> j</C> is present instead.  In this way, all the
    possible edges are encoded one-by-one.

    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr := TournamentLineDecoder("100001");
<digraph with 4 vertices, 6 edges>
gap> OutNeighbours(gr);

<#GAPDoc Label="AdjacencyMatrixUpperTriangleLineDecoder">
<ManSection>
  <Func Name="AdjacencyMatrixUpperTriangleLineDecoder" Arg="str"/>
  <Returns>A digraph.</Returns>
  <Description>
    This function takes a string <A>str</A>, decodes it, and then returns the
    topologically sorted digraph [see <Ref Attr="DigraphTopologicalSort"/>]
    which it defines, according to the following rules. <P/>

    The characters of the string <A>str</A> represent the entries in the upper
    triangle of a digraph's adjacency matrix. The number of vertices <C>n</C>
    will be detected from the length of the string and will be as large as
    possible.  <P/>

    The first character represents the possible edge <C>1 -> 2</C>, the second
    represents <C>1 -> 3</C> and so on until <C>1 -> n</C>; then the following
    character represents <C>2 -> 3</C>, and so on up to the character which
    represents the edge <C>n-1 -> n</C>.  If a character of the string with
    corresponding edge <C>i -> j</C> is equal to <C>1</C>, then this edge is
    present in the digraph. Otherwise, it is not present.  In this way, all the
    possible edges are encoded one-by-one. <P/>

    In particular, note that there exists no edge <C>[i, j]</C> if <M>j \leq
      i</M>.  In order words, the digraph will be topologically sorted.

    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr := AdjacencyMatrixUpperTriangleLineDecoder("100001");
<digraph with 4 vertices, 2 edges>
gap> OutNeighbours(gr);
[ [ 2 ], [  ], [ 4 ], [  ] ]

<digraph with 5 vertices, 9 edges>

<#GAPDoc Label="TCodeDecoder">
<ManSection>
  <Func Name="TCodeDecoder" Arg="str"/>
  <Returns>A digraph.</Returns>
  <Description>
    If <A>str</A> is a string consisting of at least two non-negative integers
    separated by spaces, then this function will attempt to return the digraph
    which it defines as a TCode string. <P/>

    The first integer of the string defines the number of vertices <C>v</C> in
    the digraph, and the second defines the number of edges <C>e</C>.  The
    following <C>2e</C> integers should be vertex numbers in the range <C>[0 ..
      v-1]</C>. These integers are read in pairs and define the digraph's
    edges.  This function will return an error if <A>str</A> has fewer than
    <C>2e+2</C> entries. <P/>

    Note that the vertex numbers will be incremented by 1 in the digraph
    returned.  Hence the string fragment <C>0 6</C> will describe the edge
    <C>[1,7]</C>.
    <Example><![CDATA[
gap> gr := TCodeDecoder("3 2 0 2 2 1");
<digraph with 3 vertices, 2 edges>
gap> OutNeighbours(gr);
[ [ 3 ], [  ], [ 2 ] ]
