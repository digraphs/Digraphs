# README for digraphs-lib

### Library of digraphs for the Digraphs package of GAP ###

In this directory is a collection of various types of digraphs, which can be
loaded into the GAP computational algebra system using the [Digraphs
package](https://digraphs.github.io/Digraphs).  It is a
completely optional addition to the package, which can be used to produce
examples of digraphs for use in the package.


Getting digraphs-lib
--------------------
The latest version of this library is available at
<https://digraphs.github.io/Digraphs>.

Simply download the archive, and extract it into the root directory of your
Digraphs installation.  This should result in a `digraphs-lib` directory inside
your `digraphs` directory.


Using digraphs-lib
------------------
Once the library is installed, simply launch GAP, load the Digraphs package, and
use the `ReadDigraphs` function on one of the files in the `digraph-lib`
directory.  This will return a list of digraphs which can be used as required.

Here is an example GAP session:

The following files contain symmetric digraphs (i.e. graphs) taken from the
[nauty and Traces website](http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/Graphs.html), by
Brendan McKay and Adolfo Piperno:

  * `ag.s6.gz` - Affine geometry graphs

  * `sts.g6.gz` - Steiner triple system graphs
  * `sts-sw.g6.gz` - Steiner triple system graphs with switched edges
  * `triang.g6.gz` - Triangular graphs

There are also some additional files, added by Jan De Beule, which containing
graphs that come from finite geometry, which were

  * `fining.p.gz` contains some graphs coming from finite geometries:
    1. The vertices are the generators of the hermitian polar space `H(5,4)`,
       two vertices are adjacent iff they are skew.
    2. The vertices are the generators of the hermitian quadrangle `H(4,4)`, two
       vertices are adjacent iff they are skew.
    3. The vertices are the points and lines of the classical generalised
       quadrangle `Q(4,8)`, two vertices are adjacent iff they are distinct and
       incident (no loops!). This is a bipartite graph with diameter 4 and
       undirected girth 8.
    4. The bipartite graph (see (3)) of an elation generalised quadrangle.  This
       one was constructed as a coset geometry.
    5. The bipartite graph of the split Cayley hexagon of order 4, the diameter
       is 6 and the girth is 12.
    6. The bipartite graph of the Ree-Tits generalised octagon. This has
       diameter 8 and girth 16!
  
  * `polar_graphs.p.gz` A polar graph is by definition the point graph of a
    finite classical polar space. Note that such a geometry is a partial linear
    space, so not every pair of points is a pair of collinear points. Two points
    are adjacent iff they are distinct and collinear. The diameter of these
    graphs is 2, their undirected girth 3, the latter since these spaces contain
    lines.  Reading in this file requires around 4 Gb of memory.

  * `dual_polar_graphs.p.gz` We consider again finite classical polar spaces.
    Such geometries contain points, lines, etc., up to maximal subspaces, which
    all have the same projective dimension. The vertices of a dual polar graph
    are these maximal subspaces, of dimension, say, `d`, and they are adjacent
    iff they are distinct and meet in a `d-1` dimensional projective subspace.
    Reading in this file requires around 5 Gb of memory.
     
  * `generators_graphs.p.gz` (Parts 1, 2, and 3). We again consider finite
    classical polar spaces. The vertices are the maximal subspaces and they are
    adjacent iff they are distinct and skew. Reading part 2 requires almost 6 Gb
    of memory, and reading part 3 requires another 6 Gb. Reading part 1 requires
    much less memory, around 1.5 Gb.
      
  * `incidence_graphs.p.gz` A generalised polygon of gonality n is a point line
    geometry, such that if one considers the incidence graph, i.e. the vertices
    are the points and adjacency is incidence (without loops), then it has
    diameter n and girth 2n. All graphs in this file are incidence graphs of
    generalised polygons. Note that by a famous theorem, thick GPs (i.e. at
    least three points on a line and dually, at least three lines on a point),
    have gonality 3, 4, 6, or 8. This file contains the incidence graph of the
    smallest generalised octogon, some generalised hexagons, and a lot of
    generalised quadrangles, and some projective planes.  To read it completely,
    around 1.5 Gb of memory is required.
