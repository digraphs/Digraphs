## Version 0.7.1 (released 22/03/2017)
This is a minor release, which fixes bugs in `DigraphTopologicalSort` and
`IsAntisymmetricDigraph` that could trigger segmentation faults.

## Version 0.7.0 (released 14/03/2017)
This release introduces several new features, changes some existing
functionality, and improves the documentation. The changes in this release were
made by [Wilf A. Wilson](https://wilf.me).

### New Features in Version 0.7.0
* This release contains a new technique for encoding a vertex-coloured
  *multidigraph* as a vertex-coloured (undirected) graph while preserving the
  automorphism group, in order to calculate the automorphism group and canonical
  labelling using bliss. This enables the following functionality:
  * the operations `AutomorphismGroup` and `DigraphCanonicalLabelling` for a
    digraph and a vertex-colouring now accept a multidigraph as their first
    argument;
  * the operations `IsIsomorphicDigraph` and `IsomorphismDigraphs` now accept
    multidigraphs, and they also accept vertex-colourings as optional arguments.
  
* This release add new functionality related to undirected spanning trees and
  undirected spanning forests:
  * the property `IsUndirectedForest` is introduced;
  * the attributes `UndirectedSpanningTree` and `UndirectedSpanningForest` are
    introduced; and
  * the operations `IsUndirectedSpanningTree` and `IsUndirectedSpanningForest`
    are introduced.

### Altered Behaviour in Version 0.7.0
* The behaviour of `IsSubdigraph` is changed in the case that it is given one or
  two multidigraphs.
* The one-argument version of the operation `DigraphColouring` (and its synonym,
  `DigraphColoring`) is now an attribute.

## Version 0.6.1 (released 01/03/2017)
This is a minor release. This release fixes a bug in `AsDigraph` for a
transformation and an integer. The operations `OutNeighboursCopy` and
`OutNeighborsCopy` are renamed to `OutNeighboursMutableCopy` and
`OutNeighborsMutableCopy`, respectively, and new operations
`InNeighboursMutableCopy` and `InNeighborsMutableCopy` are introduced.

## Version 0.6.0 (released 09/12/2016)
This is a major release, adding a variety of new operations and attributes
for Digraphs, as well as improving some functions and improving the
package's documentation.  In this version, we welcome Luke Elliott and
Markus Pfeiffer as new authors.

### New Features in Version 0.6.0
* The ability to label the edges of digraphs is introduced. [[Markus Pfeiffer](https://www.morphism.de/~markusp)]
* The operation `CompleteMultipartiteDigraph` is introduced. [Stuart Burrell and [Wilf A. Wilson](https://wilf.me)]
* The operations `ReadDIMACSDigraph` and `WriteDIMACSDigraph` are introduced.
  [[Wilf A. Wilson](https://wilf.me)]
* The operation `ChromaticNumber` is introduced. [[James D. Mitchell](http://goo.gl/ZtViV6) and [Wilf A. Wilson](https://wilf.me)]
* The operations `IsDirectedTree` and `IsUndirectedTree` are introduced. [Luke Elliott]
* The operation `IsEulerianDigraph`is introduced. [Luke Elliott]
	
## Version 0.5.2 (released 20/06/2016)
This is a minor release containing one bugfix and several other minor changes.
Digraphs now works when it and GAP are compiled in 32 bit mode.

## Version 0.5.1 (released 08/06/2016)
This release contains some bugfixes, some minor new features, and some
performance improvements. The package has moved to GitHub and we welcome Finn
Smith as an author.

This release contains a new technique for encoding a vertex-coloured digraph as a vertex-coloured (undirected) graph while preserving the automorphism group, in order to calculate the automorphism group using bliss. These changes were made by Finn Smith. The previous technique involved adding two intermediate vertices for every edge; on a digraph with `n` vertices this could add `2n(n-1)` new vertices. The new technique encodes a digraph with `n` vertices as a graph with `3n` vertices. In certain cases, this can lead to a dramatic improvement in the time taken to calculate the automorphism group.

The new reduction is based on two techniques in: 

> David Bremner, Mathieu Dutour Sikiric, Dmitrii V. Pasechnik, Thomas Rehn, Achill Sch√ºrmann. Computing symmetry groups of polyhedra. https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0206v3

Namely, "Dealing with digraphs" followed by "Reduction by superposition". From the graph obtained by these techniques, `n` vertices which are irrelevant to automorphism finding are removed.

The actual reduction used is as follows: Given a digraph `D=(V=[]1 .. n],E,c)`, create three copies `V1`, `V2`, `V3` of the vertex set `V`. Colour `V1` according to the colouring `c` of `D`, and `V2`, `V3` with two distinct colours that do not occur in `D`. Connect each vertex in `V1` to the corresponding vertices in `V2`, `V3`. For every arc `(x,y)` in `E`, put an edge between the copy of `x` in `V2`, and the copy of `y` in `V3`. Automorphisms of this graph, when restricted to `V`, are precisely the automorphisms of `D`. 
Because this changes the graph used to calculate automorphisms, the results sometimes nominally differ from the previous version - especially in the case of canonical labelling, where unrecognisably different results may appear. Generators also often appear in different orders. 

The performance improvements are most noticeable on large, quite dense digraphs. On random digraphs with 5000 vertices and 0.5 edge probability, 200-400x speedups were common. When calculating the automorphism group of the complete digraph on 1000 vertices, with vertex `i` having colour `i mod 2 + 1`, we obtain a 66x speedup. When the vertex `i` is assigned colour `i mod 7 + 1`, this becomes a 400x speedup.  

Minor changes include:

* a better method for `DigraphReverse` [[Wilf A. Wilson](http://wilf.me)]
* automorphism groups of complete, empty, cycle, chain, and complete bipartite
digraphs are set at creation [[Michael Torpey](http://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~mct25)]
* a minor improvement in performance in the `DigraphMaximalCliques` [[Wilf A. Wilson](http://wilf.me)]
* a new operation `AdjacencyMatrixMutableCopy` [[James D. Mitchell](http://goo.gl/ZtViV6)]

## Version 0.5.0 (released 03/03/2016)
This release contains some bugfixes, as well as new and changed functionality.
Digraphs now requires the [Orb package](http://gap-packages.github.io/orb/),
version 4.7.5 or higher.

### New Features in Version 0.5.0
* `DigraphFile` and `IteratorFromDigraphFile` are introduced. [[James D. Mitchell](http://goo.gl/ZtViV6)]
* `WriteDigraphs` and `ReadDigraphs` can now take a file as a first argument. [[James D. Mitchell](http://goo.gl/ZtViV6)]
* The operation `DigraphPath` is introduced to find a path between two vertices
  in a digraph. [[Wilf A. Wilson](http://wilf.me)]
* The operation `IteratorOfPaths` is introduced to iterate over the paths
  between two vertices in a digraph. [[Wilf A. Wilson](http://wilf.me)]
* The property `IsCompleteBipartiteDigraph` is introduced. [[Wilf A. Wilson](http://wilf.me)]

### Issues Resolved in Version 0.5.0
Several bugs related to clique finding have been resolved. [[Wilf
Wilson](http://wilf.me)]

* Files with extension `bz2` were previously not (un)compressed when used with
  `ReadDigraphs` and `WriteDigraphs`. [[James D. Mitchell](http://goo.gl/ZtViV6)]
* The documentation in Chapter 8 "Finding cliques and independent sets" has been
  corrected to accurately reflect the functionality of the package.
* A bug which led to too few cliques and independent sets being found for some
  digraphs has been resolved.

  digraphs has been resolved.
