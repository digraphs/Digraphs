        pos, start, end: used to store a visibility representation, or
                horvert diagram, of a planar graph.
                For vertices, vertical position, horizontal range
        drawingFlag, ancestor, ancestorChild: used to collect information needed
                to help 'draw' a visibility representation.  During planar
                embedding, a vertex is determined to be between its DFS parent and
                a given ancestor (the vertex being processed) or beyond the parent
                relative to the ancestor. In post processing, the relative
                orientation of the parent and ancestor are determined,
                then the notion of between/beyond resolves to above/below or
                below/above depending on whether the ancestor is above or below,
                respectively, the parent.  The ancestorChild are used to help r
                esolve this latter question.
        tie[2]  stores information along the external face during embedding
                that is pertinent to helping break ties in the decisions about
                vertical vertex positioning.  When vertices are first merged
                together into a bicomp, we cannot always decide right away which
                vertices will be above or below others.  But as we traverse the
                external face removing inactive vertices, these positional ties
                can be resolved.
